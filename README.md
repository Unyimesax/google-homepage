# google-homepage
This is Odin's first project which  entails building the google homepage or a look-alike version of it. 
I find it quite interesting because with this project, i learnt some new html tags, and how to copy css/ styling properties 
from existing web pages. i also learnt a few css tricks which would definitely come in handy when working on my own project.
 The files in the repo are the html and css for the webpage, also you'll find the google logo/image used inside the image folder.
